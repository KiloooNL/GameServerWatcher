TODO:

- SORT file names

  - cstrike should be renamed to sourceQuery.php
  - half-life should be renamed to goldSrcQuery.php (or valve.php)
  - quake3 should be renamed to quake.php

  This is so these classes/protocols represent the game engine used for each server type, and there will be no confusion between files.
